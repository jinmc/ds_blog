<p>정답</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>B is correct because of the requirement to support occasionally (schema) changing JSON files and aggregate ANSI SQL queries: you need to use BigQuery, and it is quickest to use &lsquo;Automatically detect&rsquo; for schema changes.
A is not correct because you should not provide format files: you can simply turn on the &lsquo;Automatically detect&rsquo; schema changes flag.
C, D are not correct because you should not use Cloud Storage for this scenario: it is cumbersome and doesn&rsquo;t add value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>D. Create separate Dataproc clusters to support analytics and data processing, and point both at the same Cloud Storage bucket that contains the Parquet files that were previously stored on HDFS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A is not correct because this will just return one row.
B is not correct because this doesn’t get you the latest value, but will get you a sum of the same event over time which doesn’t make too much sense if you have duplicates.
C is not correct because if you have events that are not duplicated, it will be excluded.
D is correct because it will just pick out a single row for each set of duplicates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Is correct because the question requires delay be handled on a per-player basis and session windowing will do that. Pub/Sub handles the need to scale exponentially with traffic coming from around the globe.
B Is not correct because Apache Kafka will not be able to handle an exponential growth in users globally as well as Pub/Sub.
C is not correct because a global window does not meet the requirements of handling out-of-order delay on a per-player basis.
D is not correct because a global window does not meet the requirements of handling out-of-order delay on a per-player basis.

<li>
<p>A is not correct because if another data format other than CSV was selected then the data would not import successfully.
B is not correct because the data was fully imported meaning no rows were skipped.
C is correct because this is the only situation that would cause successful import.
D is not correct because whether the data has been previously transformed will not affect whether the source file will match the BigQuery table.

<li>
<p>A is not correct because the goal is to re-use their Hadoop jobs and MapReduce and/or Spark jobs cannot simply be moved to Dataflow.
B is not correct because the goal is to persist the data beyond the life of the ephemeral clusters, and if HDFS is used as the primary attached storage mechanism, it will also disappear at the end of the cluster’s life.
C is not correct because the goal is to use managed services as much as possible, and this is the opposite.
D is correct because it uses managed services, and also allows for the data to persist on GCS beyond the life of the cluster.
E is not correct because of the same reasons as option C.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>C is correct because the data type, volume, and query pattern best fits BigTable capabilities and also Google best practices as linked below.
A, B are not correct because you do not need to use BigQuery for the query pattern in this scenario.
D is not correct because you can use the simpler method of &lsquo;cbt tool&rsquo; to support this scenario.

</li>
<li>
<p>A is correct because of recommended Google practices; see the links below.
B is not correct because you should not attach a GUID to each message to support the scenario.
C, D are not correct because you should not use Apache Kafka for this scenario (it is overly complex compared to using Pub/Sub, which can support all of the requirements).

<p>A Is correct because Bigtable can store and analyze time series data, and the solution is using managed services which is what the requirements are calling for.
B Is not correct because BigTable cannot limit access to specific tables.
C is not correct because it requires deployment of an HBase cluster.
D is not correct because it requires deployment of a Cassandra cluster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>B is correct because of the requirement to use custom Spark transforms; use Dataproc. ANSI SQL queries require the use of BigQuery.
A is not correct because Dataflow does not support Spark.
C, D are not correct because Cloud Storage does not support SQL, and you should not use Dataflow, either.

<p>B. There is no per-user metric being used so it’s possible a sum will be created for some users while they are still browsing the site.
D. If a user is still visiting the site when the 30-min window closes, the sum will be wrong.
C. This is correct because it continues to sum user page visits during their browsing session and completes at the same time as the session timeout.
A. A user-specific sum is never calculated, just sums for arbitrary 30-min windows of time staggered by 5 minutes.

C is correct because Cloud Spanner scales horizontally, and you can create secondary indexes for the range queries that are required.
D is not correct because Dataflow is a data pipelining tool to move and transform data, but the use case is centered around querying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A is not correct because this will cause most writes to be pushed to a single node (known as hotspotting)
B is not correct because this will not allow for multiple readings from the same sensor as new readings will overwrite old ones.
C is not correct because this will cause most writes to be pushed to a single node (known as hotspotting)
D is correct because it will allow for retrieval of data based on both sensor id and timestamp but without causing hotspotting.

</li>
<li>
<p>A is correct because it provides a managed service and a fully trained model, and the user is pulling the entities, which is the right label.
B is not correct because sentiment is the incorrect label for this use case.
C is not correct because this requires experience with machine learning.
D is not correct because this requires experience with machine learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A is not correct because this is not the correct wildcard syntax as there is no wildcard character present.
B is not correct because this is not the correct wildcard syntax since it’s missing backticks.
C is not correct because this is not the correct wildcard syntax since it’s not using a backtick as the last character
D is correct because it follows the correct wildcard syntax of enclosing the table name in backticks and including the * wildcard character.

</li>
<li>
<p>A Is correct because synchronous mode is recommended for short audio files.
B is incorrect since the recommended way to process short audio files (shorter than 1 minutes) is a synchronous recognize request and not an asynchronous one.
C Is incorrect since using the native sample rate is recommended over resampling.
D Is incorrect since there is nothing in the question that suggests the off-the-shelf model will not perform sufficiently.

</li>
<li>
<p>B is correct because of the requirement to quickly develop a model that generates landmark labels from photos.
This is supported in Cloud Vision API; see the link below.
A is not correct because you should not inspect the generated MID values; instead, you should simply pass the image locations to the API and use the labels, which are output.
C, D are not correct because you should not build a custom classification TF model for this scenario.
ref : <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/labels">https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/labels</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>B is correct because of the requirement to host an ML DNN and Google-recommended monitoring object (Jobs); see the links below.
A is not correct because you should not use the Operation object to monitor failures.
C, D are not correct because you should not use a Kubernetes Engine cluster for this scenario.

</li>
<li>
<p>A Is incorrect since test sample is large enough
C Is incorrect since regularization helps to avoid overfitting and we have a clear underfitting case
B is incorrect since dataset is pretty large already, and having more data typically helps with overfitting and not with underfitting
D Is correct since increasing model complexity generally helps when you have an underfitting problem</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>B Is not correct because duplication in this case could be caused by a terminal re-try, in which case messageId could be different for the same event.
A Is not correct because publishTime cannot uniquely identify a message and it does not address push retries.
D is correct because the client application must include a unique identifier to disambiguate possible duplicates due to push retries.
C is not correct because there are many terminals. Calculating the projected inventory values on the terminal introduces a race condition where multiple terminals could update the inventory data simultaneously.
ref : <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs#duplicates">https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs#duplicates</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A is not correct because adding additional compute resources is not a recommended way to resolve database schema problems.
B is not correct because this will reduce the functionality of the database and make running reports more difficult.
C is correct because this option provides the least amount of inconvenience over using pre-specified date ranges or one table per clinic while also increasing performance due to avoiding self-joins.
D is not correct because this will likely increase the number of tables so much that it will be more difficult to generate reports vs. the correct option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A is correct because this is the best way to get granular access to data showing which users are accessing which data.
B is not correct because we already know that all users already have access to all data, so this information is unlikely to be useful. It will also not show what users have done, just what they can do.
C is not correct because slot usage will not inform security policy.
D is not correct because a billing account is typically shared among many people and will only show the amount of data queried and stored.

</li>
<li>
<p>D is correct because the scenario requires you to use your own key and also to not store your key on Compute Engine, and also this is a Google recommended practice; see the links below.
A is not correct because the scenario states that you must supply your own encryption key instead of using one generated by Google Cloud.
B is not correct because the scenario states that you should use, but not store, your own key with Google Cloud services.
C is not correct because it does not meet the scenario requirement to reference, but not store, your own key with Google Cloud services.
ref : <a href="https://cloud.google.com/docs/security/encryption/default-encryption,">https://cloud.google.com/docs/security/encryption/default-encryption,</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>B is correct because it uses the principle of least privilege for IAM roles; use the Billing Administrator IAM role for that job function.
A, C, D are not correct because it is a best practice to use pre-defined IAM roles when they exist and match your business scenario; see the links below.
