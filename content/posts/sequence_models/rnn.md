## Notation 

- one hot encoding

## Why not a standard network?

Problems:
- Inputs, outputs can be different lengths in different examples.
- Doesn't share features learned across different positions of text.

## Recurrent Neural Networks

 - Forward Propagation

## Backpropagagtion through time

 - many to one (Sentiment classification)
 - many to many (machine translation)
 - one to many (music generation)

## What is language modeling?

## Language Model and Sequence Generation

## Sampling a sequence from a trained RNN
