Week 1 review
</h2>
<p>
When using R, the IDE highly recommended is RStudio.
</p>

```
# installing the dslabs package
install.packages("dslabs")
# loading the dslabs package into the R session
library(dslabs)
```

<ul>
  <li>To define a variable, we may use the assignment symbol, <code>&lt;-</code>.</li>
<li>There are two ways to see the value stored in a variable: (1) type the variable name into the console and hit Return, or (2) use the <code>print()</code> function by typing <code>print(variable_name)</code> and hitting Return.</li>
<li>Objects are things that are stored in named containers in R.&nbsp; They can be variables, functions, etc.</li>
  <li>The <code>ls()</code> function shows the names of the objects saved in your workspace.</li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>function class() helps as determine the type of object </li>
</ul>
