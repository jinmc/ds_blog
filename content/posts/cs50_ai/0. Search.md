Maze -> 길찾기

Using Stack => DFS (찾기만!)

Using Queue => BFS

갈래길 => DFS 끝까지, BFS 

BFS -> leads us to optimal Solution 

단점 : 너무 오래걸린다

​

Greedy Best-First Search

-> search algorithm that expands the node that is closest to the goal, as estimated by a heuristic function h(n)

=> Not guaranteed!

​

A* search

-> search algorithm that expands nodes with lowest value of g(n) + h(n)

​

g(n) = cost to reach node

h(n) = estimated cost to goal

​

A* search can find optimal search algorithm which can find a solution

​

A* search is optimal if 

- h(n) is admissible (never overestimates the free cost), and

- h(n) is consistent(for every node n and successor n' with step cost c, h(n) <= h(n') + c)

​

Adversarial Search - Adversary

win -> 1

draw -> 0 

lose  -> -1

​

​

MINIMAX

for Tic-Tac-Toe

MAX(X) aims to maximize score

MIN(O) aims to minimize score

​

Given a state S:

- Max picks action a in ACTIONS(s) that produces highest value of MIN-VALUE(RESULT(s, a))

- Min picks action a in ACTIONS(s) that produces smallest value of MAX-VALUE(RESULT(s, a))

​

​

​

​

pseudocode for MAX-VALUE (similar for MIN-VALUE)

​

function MAX-VALUE(state):

if TERMINAL(state):

return UTILITY(state)

v = -inf

for action in ACTIONS(state):

v = MAX(u, MIN-VALUE(RESULT(state, action))

return v

​

Alpha beta pruning (thinking of the opponent's move also)

-> can save a lot of time 

-> but not enough! (too much memory needed)

​

3-   1-    2

Alpha-beta pruning

=> 단점 : 너무 오래걸린다

​

Depth Limited Minimax -> will estimate after some moves

- Evaluation function ()

-> function that estimates the expected utility of the game from a given state
