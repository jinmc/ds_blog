summary: "Motivation of learning data science and R"

<p>
Even though now I know a few programming languages, such as Python, Java, C, C#, Javascript, and I am currently working as a Magento Developer which is quite overwhelming itself, I have the urge to learn Data Science and R.
</p>
<p>The main reason I am learning R is because I am following the Course of Harvard's Data science Professional Certificate. I have bought the whole course which is estimated as almost a year to complete for only 400 dollars, and I am really motivated to finish it. This is the link for who are interested :

As I learn more and more about computer science and the web development sector in which I currently work, I realize that it is a huge field and new technologies are comming out every single day, which makes it impossible to know everything about the web technology. 
</p>
<p>
Also, the problem of web programming is that we can do the same thing for hundreds of other ways with more than 10 programming languages, and more frameworks with one language. So it won't be much benefit even though you become an expert about one framework, one language, because it will be no use if you use another framework, another language.
</p>
<p>
Even though that is the case, we have to learn new languages, and new frameworks, and new concepts 
because that's what programming is about, and that's why I like programming. It's never a same job every day. Because of that, I'm not afraid of learning a new lanuguage. I like learning new languages whenever I can.

Web development is great, both backend and frontend, and I am glad I get to learn it and I have a job and I can make a living out of it. I am able to make blogs like this independent of big domain names, (although I am relying on github), and I am able to talk to the world. Although, I cannot stop thinking that this is just a tool, and coding is just more than hosting html pages on the world wide web and transfer info with it.
</p>
<p>
I won't say all the magnificent things machine learning can lead us into such as self-driving cars, alphagos, and whatnot, but it's just sucha an exciting idea just to learn about the technology and the logic of the idea that we can predict the future with the data we have. We are in the world of big data, and the data we have stored in the last 10 years would be more than the data we have stored in the rest of the mankind's history.

Just one thing before I go. When I was contemplating whether to change my degree (actually do a double degree) from materials science to computer science, my good friend Jon who was at the same class as me said to me. At that time, I was so concerned about my move, am I too old for this, or is it too risky to do this, or worry that the tuition was too high(it was actually). 

> Even though you don't like it, you can always go back to materials science. If you are thinking about it this much, just do it.

And I did. I'm glad I did it, changed my life entirely, till this day.
So I'm gonna follow his advice again, knowing that even if I don't like it, I'm just going back to 
web development anyways.

Hope this helps any others.
